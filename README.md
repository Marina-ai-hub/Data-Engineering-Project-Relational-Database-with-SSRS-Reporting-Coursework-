# Data-Engineering-Project-Relational-Database-with-SSRS-Reporting-Coursework-
**Title:** Design and implementation of a relational database for a multi‑category e‑commerce store with Microsoft SSRS/Report Builder integration.
**Tools:** Microsoft SQL Server (2022), SQL Server Management Studio 20 (SSMS), SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) and Report Builder, draw.io.
Objective. The information system is created with the aim of facilitating the process of various types of documentation and tracking business processes, events related to sales, order management and accounting of financial transactions. Implementation through an intuitive mechanism for entering, editing and quickly searching for the necessary data. The system should provide a clear mechanism for entering, editing, filtering and searching data, as well as procedures for generating analytical reporting for decision-making.
**Scope and features.**
*Data modelling: DFD0, DFD1, DFD3; infological and datalogical ER models.
*Database implementation: DDL for tables, constraints, data types; integrity and indexing.
*Business logic: stored procedures, user-defined functions, cursors and triggers; views for frequent analytics; parameterised queries for reports.
*Security: role‑based permissions for internal users and external roles: database-level roles for online store employees (system administrator, analyst, manager, accountant, logistics), and application roles for external users (clients, suppliers, delivery person).
*Reporting (SSRS). To create reports, a connection was made to a common data source “WebShop”, after which data sets were formed to be used in the design of reports.
